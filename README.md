Odin-flight-booker is a simple app created in Rails that allows the user to book flights based on the 
desired date, flight origin and flight destination. The app, created as part of the curriculum at 
[theOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms), is designed to harness the developer's ability to establish relationships between 
multiple tables.
